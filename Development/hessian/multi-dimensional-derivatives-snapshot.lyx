\begin_layout Abstract
Analysis of the second derivatives of vector valued functions require the
 definition of a multi-dimensional Hessian.
 Rules for three dimensional matrix operations are defined and used to analyze
 some issues in demand and market analysis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In various problems, multi-dimensional derivatives can be of use in calculation.
 For a real valued function of several variables, the first derivative is
 a vector valued function and the second derivative is a matrix valued function.
 Higher dimensional derivatives require a representation beyond the standard
 objects and operations of matrix algebra.
 Similarly, for vector or matrix valued functions, the second and first
 derivatives require a representation of derivative rules beyond standard
 analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Magnus & Neudecker (1999), the multi dimensional Hessian is represented
 as a 
\begin_inset Formula $pn\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix, with operations involving the Kronecker product to project extra
 dimensions onto a two dimensional matrix representation of the derivative.
 This strategy is less appealing than the one chosen in this paper for two
 reasons.
 Kronecker products generate sparse matrices in their representation, requiring
 sparse matrix computations or an computational implementation that does
 not correspond to the operations as defined.
 We also believe that operations defined in this way are less clear than
 one based on multi-dimensional matrices, with each derivative occupying
 a single separate dimension.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We develop methods required to handle multi dimensional derivatives in the
 context of marked demand and equilibrium.
 Complete generality of the methods defined has not been a goal of the analysis.
 One can for example define multiplication of multi dimensional matrices
 in various other ways than the ones chosen.
 Only the methods required for differentiation of matrix expressions are
 defined.
 The analysis can relatively easily be extended to higher derivatives, with
 matrices of more than three dimensions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tools developed are then applied in the analysis of mixed logit demand
 and markets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In a model with many random coefficients, the Hessian of the objective with
 respect to the random coefficients is important in finding an equilibrium.
 The Hessian could possibly eliminate local equilibria and improve the robustnes
s of BLP estimation with many random coefficients.
 In addition the number of steps required in the optimization is reduced,
 increasing the speed of estimation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Most of the computational time in a BLP estimation is in the contraction,
 the fixed point itreation to find the average utilities.
 With a Hessian, a better guess for a starting point for an iteration can
 be made, using a second order Taylor expansion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Finding an equilibrium in a multi-product market entails finding the price
 vector solving a n-dimensional root problem 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(p\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 The Newton method is the most common method to solve multi-dimensional
 fixed point problems.
 It uses the derivative of the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 to find the price 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 satisfying the equation.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is the first order condition, it includes the Jacobian matrix of demand.
 A derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 necessitates the calculation of a three-dimensional Hessian.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Routines for handling multi dimensional arrays have been implemented in
 C++ using the Armadillo library, and Hessians for random coefficient and
 nested logit demand in Matlab and C++.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Multi-dimensional matrices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here define matrix operations on three-dimensional arrays analogously to
 the definition of standard matrix operations.
 We will not provide a full generalization, with for example all possible
 types of vector based multiplications.
 The extensions provided are ones that are sufficient to handle rules of
 derivations of second derivatives of vector valued functions.
 The extension to higher order derivatives using higher dimensional arrays
 require only a little more notation, however.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A three dimensional array is an ordered set of matrices of identical dimensions.
 Arrays are said to have rows, columns and layers.
 A 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times n\times k$
\end_inset

 array consists of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 rows (
\begin_inset Formula $n\times k$
\end_inset

 matrices), etc.
 We will define array multiplication along the lines of matrix multiplication,
 with the resultant array having elements that are dot products of vectors
 from the arrays multiplied, as this is sufficient to specify product and
 chain rules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Multi-dimensional matrix operations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To reduce notation, in the following we let 
\begin_inset Formula $m,n,k$
\end_inset

 denote both indeces in a certain dimension and the dimensionality.
 Multiplication by scalar and addition of arrays will be defined as with
 matrices, requiring identical dimensions in the latter case.
 For practical reasons we will allow the element by element operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\odot$
\end_inset

 (the Hadamard product) to multiply a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 with an array 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, given that their first two dimensions are identical.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times m$
\end_inset

 matrix and 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times m\times k$
\end_inset

 cube, we let 
\begin_inset Formula $K\odot M=M\odot K$
\end_inset

 be the cube where each layer of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is multiplied term by term with 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Vector multiplication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A two dimensional matrix can be pre- and post multiplied by a vector.
 The transposed vector is multiplied by each row/column in turn, reducing
 this dimension to one.
 Similarly, a three dimensional array can multipy in three directions.
 Post-multiplication 
\begin_inset Formula $Ax$
\end_inset

 implies that each row of the array 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is multiplied by the (transposed) column vector 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 The transpose of 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is here denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{T}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A three-dimensional matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 can be multiplied by a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 in three directions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Premultiplication 
\begin_inset Formula $b{}^{T}A$
\end_inset

 multiplies the elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 along it's first dimension, rows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Postmultiplication 
\begin_inset Formula $Ab$
\end_inset

 multiplies along the second dimension, columns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Layer multiplication, here denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $A\cdot b$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b{}^{T}\cdot A$
\end_inset

, multiplies 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 along the third dimension, layers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Analogously to the transformation of 1x1 matrices to scalars, we can collapse
 arrays to matrices if the number of items in one direction is 1.
 Thus for example post-multiplying an array by a vector creates an array
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Matrix multiplication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A definition of array multiplication has to specify two things
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
how to choose vectors of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 to combine to form an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
the order in which the vector multiplications are stacked in 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 In using the product, we might need a transposition in order to obtain
 the correct individual terms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conceptually, it is best to think of 
\begin_inset Formula $AB$
\end_inset

 as an extension of 
\begin_inset Formula $Ab$
\end_inset

, multiplying rows of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 with columns of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in turn (i.e.
 the column index is the outer loop of the iteration).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Post multiplication of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 by a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 applies the vector multiplication above to each column 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $k\times m\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix, we define the post-multiplications 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
With 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 a 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times p$
\end_inset

 matrix, 
\begin_inset Formula $C=AB$
\end_inset

 denotes matrix multiplication in the 
\emph on
two first
\emph default
 dimensions, giving a 
\begin_inset Formula $k\times p\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix.
 Multiplication is for each layer 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 consist of rows of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 multiplied with columns of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
With 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 a 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times p$
\end_inset

 matrix, 
\begin_inset Formula $A\cdot B$
\end_inset

 denotes matrix multiplication in the 
\emph on
first and third
\emph default
 dimensions, giving a 
\begin_inset Formula $k\times m\times p$
\end_inset

 matrix.
 Multiplication is for each stack (third dimension) 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 multiplied with columns of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 It is thus a matrix multiplication for each matrix in the second dimension.
 For each column, the elements in rows and layers constitute a 
\begin_inset Formula $k\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly for pre-multiplication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
With 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 a 
\begin_inset Formula $p\times k$
\end_inset

 matrix, 
\begin_inset Formula $BA$
\end_inset

 denotes matrix multiplication in the 
\emph on
two first
\emph default
 dimensions, giving a 
\begin_inset Formula $p\times m\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix.
 Multiplication is for each layer 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
With 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 a 
\begin_inset Formula $p\times k$
\end_inset

 matrix, 
\begin_inset Formula $B\cdot A$
\end_inset

 denotes matrix multiplication in the 
\emph on
first and third
\emph default
 dimensions, giving a 
\begin_inset Formula $p\times m\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix.
 Multiplication is for each first dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 (This type of pre-multiplication is not used in the current analysis.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first type of multiplication is useful for calculations of derivatives
 of products, while the second is useful to express the multi-dimensional
 chain rule and for directional derivatives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Reduction in dimensionality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In most expositions of standard linear algebra, the transformation from
 matrices to scalars are implicit.
 We will extend this idea of implicit conversion to the reduction of dimensional
ity when multiplying an array with a vector.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As long as matrix multiplication is based on dot products of columns and
 rows, multiplying a matrix by a vector reduces the dimensionality by 1,
 multiplying by a matrix changes the number of elements in a dimension but
 leaves the dimensionality unchanged.
 Mutiplying by a three dimensional array increases the dimensionality of
 the other matrix by 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Transpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A two-dimensional matrix can be transposed.
 A three dimensional matrix has 6 configurations, that can be attained through
 a rotation of one or two steps and by transposing two dimensions keeping
 the third fixed.
 (A rotation can be achieved by a pair of transpositions.) If the dimensions
 are rows (down), columns (right) and layers (out), then a matrix reorientation
 can be described by the new order compared to the previous, all the permutation
s of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 1,2,3\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 In the applications that follow, only transposition in the first two dimensions
 are used, however.
 The transpose 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 2,1,3\right\} $
\end_inset

 implies a standard matrix transpose of each layer of a three dimensional
 array.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Multi dimensional derivatives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we will define derivatives of vector and array valued functions.
 We will derive product and chain rules by verifying that the individual
 elements have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The standard derivative
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Derivatives add a dimension to the end of matrices.
 A function 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathbb{R}^{k}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 has a 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times k$
\end_inset

 derivative (Jacobian), with the linear function being represented by post-multi
plication of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 The second derivative adds rows, creating a 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix, with the linear function being a quadratic form.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathbb{R}^{k}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{m}$
\end_inset

, the derivative (the Jacobian) is defined as a 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times k$
\end_inset

 matrix, again with post-multiplication of 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\mathbb{R}^{k}$
\end_inset

, now to get a column vector in the range space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{m}$
\end_inset

.
 The columns of the Jacobian are the partials with respect to each of the
 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 dimensions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Matrix valued derivatives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now define the derivative of vector and matrix valued functions as three
 dimensional arrays.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $F:\mathbb{R}^{k}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{mp}$
\end_inset

 be a matrix valued function, for example the Jacobian in a FOC.
 Analogously to the standard derivative, a dimension will be added to create
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times p\times k$
\end_inset

 array 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial F\left(x\right)}{\partial x}$
\end_inset

.
 Each of the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 layers in the array contain the partials of the matrix valued function
 with respect to a dimension in the domain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will allow vector valued functions to have multi dimensional derivatives,
 rather than creating the Jacobian matrix as discussed above.
 Letting 
\begin_inset Formula $m=1$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1$
\end_inset

 allows taking derivatives of row and column vector valued functions.
 The resultant derivative will be 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times p\times k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times1\times k$
\end_inset

 arrays.
 As will be shown, consistent and simple expressions of product rules emerge
 with these derivatives, in contrast with standard derivatives.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Verifying that the new and the standard rules can be used interchangably.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfinished...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order for the derivative rules to be simple for scalar, vector and matrix
 functions, we define the Hessian as a 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times n\times n$
\end_inset

 array for scalar valued functions, using the array multiplication rules
 as defined to reduce dimensionality.
 The derivative of a 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times m$
\end_inset

 vector valued function is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times m\times n$
\end_inset

, not a 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a directional derivative the two last dimensions can be multiplied by
 a direction in a Hessian differential.
 Thus we have 
\begin_inset Formula $x{}^{T}\cdot Ax$
\end_inset

, a 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times1$
\end_inset

 vector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Derivatives and linear functionals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is the Hessian, then 
\begin_inset Formula $x{}^{T}A$
\end_inset

 is the row vector representing the change in the derivative at 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 In constructing the second derivative of a real valued function 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathbb{R}^{k}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

, it can be seen as the derivative of a vector valued function.
 As the first derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$
\end_inset

 is a row vector, however, we let 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 be transpose of the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $g\left(x\right)=\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)^{T}$
\end_inset

.
 We then have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}=\left(\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial x^{2}}\right)^{T}=\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial x^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

as cross derivatives are equal for continuously differentiable functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One requirement for matrix multiplication is that directional derivatives
 work for this operation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Product rule
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We wish to define the product rule to get a resultant derivative that conforms
 with the rules above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Vector product
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With standard rules of differentiating the product rule is rather different
 than the scalar version.
 Let the function 
\begin_inset Formula $h\left(x\right)=f\left(x\right){}^{T}\cdot g\left(x\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{k}f_{i}\left(x\right)g_{i}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $h:\mathbb{R}^{k}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 has the derivative (row vector) 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{D}h\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Element 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}=g\left(x\right){}^{T}\frac{\partial f\left(x\right)}{\partial x}+f\left(x\right){}^{T}\frac{\partial g\left(x\right)}{\partial x}\label{eq:prod-rule}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The change of terms that are transposed are needed to make the terms of
 the RHS of the same dimension and the derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 a 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times k$
\end_inset

 vector valued function.
 Some intuition can be gained by the observation that 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right){}^{T}\cdot g\left(x\right)=g\left(x\right){}^{T}\cdot f\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Product of matrices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can extend the product rule to 
\begin_inset Formula $H\left(x\right)=F\left(x\right)G\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 for matrix functions 
\begin_inset Formula $F\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a term 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{mn}\left(x\right)=\sum_{p}f_{mp}\left(x\right)g_{pn}\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

The derivative wrt 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{k}$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial h_{mn}\left(x\right)}{\partial x_{k}}=\sum_{p}\frac{\partial f_{mp}\left(x\right)}{\partial x_{k}}g_{pn}\left(x\right)+\sum_{p}f_{mp}\left(x\right)\frac{\partial g_{pn}\left(x\right)}{\partial x_{k}}
\]

\end_inset

by application of the univariate product rule on each term in the sum.
 In matrix terms, this can be rewritten as the following matrix equation
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial H\left(x\right)}{\partial x_{k}}=\frac{\partial F\left(x\right)}{\partial x_{k}}G\left(x\right)+F\left(x\right)\frac{\partial G\left(x\right)}{\partial x_{k}}
\]

\end_inset

Stacking the derivative matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial H\left(x\right)}{\partial x_{k}}$
\end_inset

 into arrays, and using the definitions of array multiplications above gives
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial H\left(x\right)}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial F\left(x\right)}{\partial x}G\left(x\right)+F\left(x\right)\frac{\partial G\left(x\right)}{\partial x}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the alternate notation, this can be written as.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathsf{D}h\left(x\right)=\mathsf{D}F\left(x\right)G\left(x\right)+F\left(x\right)\mathsf{D}G\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $F:\mathbb{R}^{k}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{m\times p}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G:\mathbb{R}^{k}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{p\times n}$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{D}F\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times p\times k$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{D}G\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $p\times n\times k$
\end_inset

 matrix.
 Thus the product in both of the elements fo the sum below is 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times n\times k$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The chain rule
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $h\left(x\right)=g\left(f\left(x\right)\right)$
\end_inset

, where
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{m}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g:\mathbb{R}^{m}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{p}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{D}g$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $p\times m$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathsf{D}f$
\end_inset

 a 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix.
 The chain rule of the first derivative is given by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathsf{D}h\left(x\right)=\mathsf{D}g\left(f\left(x\right)\right)\mathbf{\mathsf{D}}f\left(x\right)\label{eq:standard-chain-rule}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

or
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

This result from standard multivariate calculus can be extended to the case

For each dimension in the range, the calculus is the same for the input

\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula

 respectively.
 With non-linear price the sums of individual chain rules cannot be simplified
 this way.
 Both partials depend on individual draws, allowing no factorization through
 the sum that averages over individuals.
 Thus, in this case 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial s}{\partial p}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{\partial s_{i}}{\partial\delta}\frac{\partial\delta_{i}}{\partial p}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{\partial s_{i}}{\partial\delta}\left(\alpha+\theta_{p}v_{i}\right)
\]

\end_inset

 where the sum is a sum of matrices.
 Similarly
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial^{2}s}{\partial p^{2}}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{\partial^{2}s_{i}}{\partial\delta^{2}}\left(\alpha+\theta_{p}v_{i}\right)^{2}
